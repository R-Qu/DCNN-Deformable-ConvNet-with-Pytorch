### DCNN-Deformable-ConvNet-with-Pytorch
* A re-implementation of deformable ConvNet as described in Dai. et. al. paper from the scratch using pytorch backend.
* Evaluate the network using the VOC2012 dataset on a pair of different popular existing neural networks, namely Deeplab 
and RPN(Region Proposal Network).
* Measure its accuracy against the reference implementation in MXNet.
